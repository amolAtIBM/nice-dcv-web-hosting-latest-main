# WebSocket Connection Error Explanation

## Error Analysis
The error message indicates that the WebSocket connection to `wss://18.212.126.212:8443/auth` is failing. This is happening during the authentication phase of the DCV (NICE DCV) connection attempt.

## Possible Causes
1. **Port Access**: Port 8443 might be blocked by a firewall or security group. This is the default HTTPS port for NICE DCV.

2. **SSL/TLS Certificate**: Since this is a WSS (WebSocket Secure) connection, there might be certificate validation issues.

3. **Server Availability**: The DCV server might not be running or accessible at the specified address.

4. **Network Configuration**: The security group or network ACL settings might be preventing the WebSocket connection.

## Recommended Solutions
1. **Check Server Status**:
   - Verify that the NICE DCV server is running on the instance
   - Use `sudo systemctl status dcvserver` to check the service status

2. **Security Group Configuration**:
   - Ensure port 8443 is open in the EC2 instance's security group
   - The security group should allow inbound traffic on port 8443 from your client IP

3. **Certificate Verification**:
   - Ensure the SSL certificate for the DCV server is valid and properly configured
   - Check if the certificate is trusted by your browser

4. **Network Connectivity**:
   - Try to telnet to the server: `telnet 18.212.126.212 8443`
   - Check if the instance is in a public subnet with proper routing

## Code Review
The code implementation in `index.js` is correct, with proper error handling and connection logic. The issue appears to be environmental rather than code-related:

- The authentication flow is properly implemented using `dcv.authenticate()`
- Error handling is in place for connection failures
- URL validation includes proper WebSocket secure (wss://) protocol

## Next Steps
1. Verify the DCV server status and configuration on the EC2 instance
2. Check security group settings in AWS console
3. Verify that the instance has a public IP and is in a public subnet
4. Review the DCV server logs for any authentication or certificate issues
